# Cyberbullying-detection-on-social-networks-using-Machine-Learning-algorithms

The goal of this research is to identify cyberbullying activity within a given dataset by using 
databases of certain text messages. The answer is found in the architecture of the Machine 
learning model. This network architecture analyses movies utilizing previously learned 
information from the twitter dataset, as well as transfer learning on more specified tasks. It 
collects features from the text messages data and the information collected from the captions 
using the Na√Øve bayes training model, allowing it to learn the vocabulary required for creating 
sentences that characterize the activities displayed in the twitter dataset. 
The fundamental goal of this project is to create a more efficient and cost-effective system for 
identifying cyberbullying activities that can examine the text messages from the twitter dataset 
for identification purposes.
